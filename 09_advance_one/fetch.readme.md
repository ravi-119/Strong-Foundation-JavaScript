# JavaScript Engine & Browser Web API Workflow

## Overview

Modern browsers use a combination of the JavaScript Engine and Browser Web APIs to execute JavaScript code and interact with the environment (DOM, timers, network, etc.). Understanding their workflow is crucial for mastering asynchronous programming, event loops, and browser behavior.

---

## 1. JavaScript Engine

The JavaScript Engine is responsible for parsing, compiling, and executing JavaScript code. Popular engines include V8 (Chrome, Node.js), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), and JavaScriptCore (Safari).

**Key Components:**
- **Call Stack:** Tracks function calls and execution context.
- **Heap:** Memory allocation for objects and variables.
- **Execution Context:** Environment in which JS code runs.

---

## 2. Browser Web APIs

Web APIs are provided by the browser (not the JS engine) and allow JavaScript to interact with the outside world, such as:
- **DOM API:** Manipulate HTML/CSS.
- **setTimeout/setInterval:** Schedule code execution.
- **Fetch/XHR:** Network requests.
- **Geolocation, Storage, etc.**

## 3. Event Loop

The Event Loop coordinates the execution of code, collecting events and executing queued sub-tasks.

Below is a simplified diagram of how JavaScript code interacts with the JS Engine, Web APIs, Callback Queue, and Event Loop:

                                      v                              |

## 5. Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **JS Code Execution:**  
   JavaScript code is parsed and executed by the JS Engine, using the Call Stack.

2. **Web API Calls:**  
   When code calls a Web API (e.g., `setTimeout`, `fetch`), the request is handled by the browser, not the JS engine.

3. **Async Operations:**  
   Once the Web API completes (e.g., timer expires, network response arrives), the callback is placed in the Callback Queue.

4. **Event Loop:**  
   The Event Loop constantly checks if the Call Stack is empty. If so, it pushes the first callback from the Callback Queue onto the Call Stack for execution.

5. **Repeat:**  
   This cycle continues, enabling asynchronous, non-blocking behavior in JavaScript.

---

## 6. Example

```js
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout Callback');
}, 0);

console.log('End');
```

**Output:**
```
Start
End
Timeout Callback
```

**Explanation:**  
- `'Start'` and `'End'` are logged synchronously.
- The `setTimeout` callback is handled by the Web API, then queued.
- The Event Loop pushes the callback to the Call Stack after synchronous code finishes.

---

## 7. Summary

- **JS Engine** executes code synchronously.
- **Web APIs** handle async operations.
- **Callback Queue** stores ready-to-run callbacks.
- **Event Loop** manages execution order, enabling non-blocking code.

---

## 8. Fetch API Workflow

The Fetch API is a modern interface for making HTTP requests in the browser. It returns a Promise and works asynchronously, leveraging the browser's Web APIs and the event loop.

### How Fetch Works

1. **Fetch Call:**  
   When `fetch()` is called, the request is handed off to the browser's Fetch Web API.

2. **Network Request:**  
   The browser performs the network operation outside the JS engine.

3. **Promise Handling:**  
   Fetch returns a Promise immediately. The JS engine continues executing subsequent code.

4. **Response Handling:**  
   When the network request completes, the Fetch API places the resolved Promise's callback into the Callback Queue.

5. **Event Loop:**  
   The Event Loop moves the callback to the Call Stack when it's empty, allowing your code to handle the response.

|   Fetch API       |  <-- Browser Web API

         |
         v

         |
         v
+-------------------+
|   JS Engine       |
|   (Call Stack)    |
+-------------------+
```

### Example: Fetch in Action

```js
console.log('Before fetch');

fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log('Fetched data:', data);
  });

console.log('After fetch');
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Before fetch
After fetch
Fetched data: { ... }
```

**Explanation:**
- `'Before fetch'` and `'After fetch'` are logged synchronously.
- The fetch request is handled by the browser's Fetch API.
- When the response arrives, the `.then` callback is queued and executed asynchronously.

---

## 9. Summary

- **Fetch API** uses browser Web APIs to perform network requests asynchronously.
- **Promises** returned by fetch allow chaining and non-blocking code.
- **Event Loop** ensures fetch callbacks run after synchronous code completes.
